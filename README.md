# Working-with-time-and-date-module-in-python
In this, we will discuss on how we format time and date as we want and we can also extract more information out of it.<BR>
If you are confused in working with date and time then take a quick look<BR>
In this, we work on two libraries i.e.<BR>
1-time library<BR>
2-datetime library<BR>
These both libraries are used for formatting date and time.<BR>
NOTE:- There are one more library i.e. calendar but here we will discuss only two.<BR>
Before going to code, take a quick look at below functions and notations<BR>
We are using the following function in the code:-<BR>
1-localtime ():- It is used to extract the current date and time and it falls in time library. It return struct type data<BR>      2-ctime ():- It is also used to extract date and time but it returns in general date time format.<BR>
3-today ():- It is used to extract  day and date and it falls in datetime library.<BR> 
4-strftime ():- We formatted data and time by using this method<BR>
   In this, we are using some notation as arguments to extract date, months, year, and many more.<BR>
Some of these notations are:-<BR>
1-	%a = Weekdays as an abbreviated name<BR>
2-	%A = Weekdays as Full Name<BR>
3-	%w = Weekdays as a decimal numbers<BR>
4-	%b = month as an abbreviated name<BR>
5-	%B = month as Full Name<BR>
6-	%j = day of the year<BR>
7-	%Y = year with century<BR>
8-	%y = year without century<BR>
GENERAL STRUCTURE OF LIST COMPREHENSION:-<BR>
(values) = [(expression) for (value) in (collection)]<BR>
